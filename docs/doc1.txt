Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

Key concepts in AI include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Expert Systems
- Neural Networks

Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized into:
1. Supervised Learning - learning with labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning - finding patterns in data without labels
3. Reinforcement Learning - learning through interaction with an environment

Popular ML frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. These tools have made AI more accessible to developers and researchers worldwide.
